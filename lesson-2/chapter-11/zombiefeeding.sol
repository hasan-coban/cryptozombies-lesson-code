in this case getKitty — and we don't mention any of the other functions or state variables.

Secondly, we're not defining the function bodies. Instead of curly braces ({ and }), we're simply ending the function declaration with a semi-colon (;).

So it kind of looks like a contract skeleton. This is how the compiler knows it's an interface.By including this interface in our dapp's code 
our contract knows what the other contract's functions look like, how to call them, and what sort of response to expect.
